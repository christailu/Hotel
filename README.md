# Hotel

"Developed a C++ program simulating a hotel booking system, allowing users to select from a menu of 3 hotels, choose a room type from 5 options, and enter the number of nights. The program then calculates the cost of the room including taxes (4%) and generates a receipt for the booking. The program also saves the receipt to a text file named "OutCIM.txt". Utilized functions, control flow, and file I/O in C++ to achieve functionality, and applied constant variables to store the percentage of taxes applied to the room booking. Program allows for multiple bookings and allows the user to exit the program when they are done."
